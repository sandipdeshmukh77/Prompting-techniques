# Prompting Techniques

This files demonstrates various prompting techniques for Large Language Models (LLMs) using Python and the OpenAI SDK. All examples are implemented in the [`prompting-techniques.ipynb`](./prompting-techniques.ipynb) Jupyter notebook.

## Techniques Covered

1. **Zero-shot Prompting**  
   Provide only the task description, no examples.

2. **Few-shot Prompting**  
   Guide the model with a few examples in the prompt.

3. **Chain-of-Thought (CoT) Prompting**  
   Encourage step-by-step reasoning in answers.

4. **Instruction Prompting**  
   Direct the model explicitly with instructions.

5. **Direct Answer Prompting**  
   Ask for just the final answer, no explanations.

6. **Persona-based Prompting**  
   Assign a persona to get responses in a specific voice or tone.

7. **Role-Playing Prompting**  
   Simulate a role or situation for the model.

8. **Contextual Prompting**  
   Inject external knowledge or previous conversation context.
